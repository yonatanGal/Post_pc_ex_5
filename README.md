I wrote all the code here be myself!! I promise.

Answer to the question:
I would define an 'edit' button which will appear next to the 'delete' button.
when the user clicks this button, a keyboard popping up, with the current text in the keyboard text field.
The user will be able to eit this text. once he's done, there will be a 'done editing' button next
to the keyboard, and when clicking on this button the keyboard will close and the edited text would 
appear in the appropriate row.
the implementation won't be hard - we will have to set two onClickListeners for these buttons,
and the logic isn't complicated at all.
I think that this flow is pretty much consistent with the regular edit flow in the android world.
