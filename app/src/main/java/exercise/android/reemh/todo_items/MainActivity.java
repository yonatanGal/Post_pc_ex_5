  }
}

SPECS:

- the screen starts out empty (no items shown, edit-text input should be empty)
- every time the user taps the "add TODO item" button:
    * if the edit-text is empty (no input), nothing happens
    * if there is input:
        - a new TodoItem (checkbox not checked) will be created and added to the items list
        - the new TodoItem will be shown as the first item in the Recycler view
        - the edit-text input will be erased
- the "TodoItems" list is shown in the screen
  * every operation that creates/edits/deletes a TodoItem should immediately be shown in the UI
  * the order of the TodoItems in the UI is:
    - all DONE items are shown first. items are sorted by creation time,
      where the last-created item is the first item in the list
    - all IN-PROGRESS items are shown afterwards, no particular sort is needed (decide what's the best UX when sorting them)
  * every item shows a checkbox and a description. you can decide to show other data as well (creation time, etc)
  * DONE items should show the checkbox as checked, and the description with a strike-through text
  * IN-PROGRESS items should show the checkbox as not checked, and the description text normal
  * upon click on the checkbox, flip the TodoItem's state (if was DONE will be IN-PROGRESS, and vice versa)
  * add a functionality to remove a TodoItem. either by a button, long-click or any other UX as you want
- when a screen rotation happens (user flips the screen):
  * the UI should still show the same list of TodoItems
  * the edit-text should store the same user-input (don't erase input upon screen change)

Remarks:
- you should use the `holder` field of the activity
- you will need to create a class extending from RecyclerView.Adapter and use it in this activity
- notice that you have the "row_todo_item.xml" file and you can use it in the adapter
- you should add tests to make sure your activity works as expected. take a look at file `MainActivityTest.java`



(optional, for advanced students:
- save the TodoItems list to file, so the list will still be in the same state even when app is killed and re-launched
)
